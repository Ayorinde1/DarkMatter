Proxy Compatibility Guide
=========================

These files are grouped by protocol compatibility:

- socks4_5.txt: Contains both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies.
- http_https.txt: Contains HTTP and HTTPS proxies.

You can load these files directly into the Traffic Bot.
The bot detects the specific protocol (e.g., socks4 vs socks5) from the URL scheme in each line,
so mixing them in these groups is perfectly safe and supported.
